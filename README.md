- In overall, the correlation between gamer and Metacritic rating is 0.6, which mean it is a moderate correlation between Metacritic score and user score. This means that as the Metacritic Scores increase, the User Scores also tend to increase, but not necessarily in a perfectly linear manner.

## Conclusion: By looking at the finding, we can assume that a highly rated game among reviewers are not exactly same as the user of the game all the time. Through the "User Top Rating Games Vs Metacritic Review" chart. We can also consider user and reviewer are more prefer Action role-playing games (ARPG), Open-world games, Fantasy games, and Story-driven games. Suprisingly, summaries of highly rated games tend to have more words than those of not highly rated games because reviewers may want to provide more information about the game to potential players, in order to help them decide whether or not to purchase the game. However, it is important to note that this is just a general trend, and there are always exceptions. There are some highly rated games that have short summaries, and there are some not highly rated games that have long summaries.
